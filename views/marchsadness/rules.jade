    div.row
        p March Sadness is an alternate take on the classic NCAA tournament bracket. Instead of filling out an entire bracket, you fill out a ballot (i.e. you pick a number of teams for each round of the tournament), and then earn points when the teams on your ballot miss shots. If you have the most points at the end of the tournament, you win!
        p In the first two rounds, you pick six teams per round. Each missed 3-point shot earns you 1 point, each missed 2-point shot earns you 2 points, and each missed free throw earns you 3 points.
        p In rounds 3 and 4, you pick three teams per round. Each missed 3-point shot earns you 2 points, each missed 2-point shot earns you 4 points, and each missed free throw earns you 6 points.
        p In the final two rounds, you pick only one team per round. Each missed 3-point shot earns you 3 points, each missed 2-point shot earns you 6 points, and each missed free throw earns you 9 points.
        p <b>No team can appear on your ballot twice</b>. Once teams are locked in for a round, you cannot use them in later rounds, so make sure to leave some teams that you expect to be around at the end.
        p <b>Picks are locked at the beginning of each round</b>. If one of your picks for a later round is eliminated from the tournament, no problem! Just remove them from your ballot and pick a new team before the next round starts.
